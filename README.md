# Project 1

Healthy Eats and Recipes is a simplified application that takes the guesswork out of planning healthy meals. Based on the users input, a healthy meal option and video on how to prepare is right at their fingertips.
The application I have developed serves two purposes:
Provide USDA standardized nutritional information about any food of choice based on the users input into a form.  The information returned will have calories, fat content, sugar content and carbohydrate content.  These are nutritional markers that many health conscious individuals are concerned about.
After returning the nutritional information for the food, the user can then select that food, and be shown YouTube videos that show top recipes of the users choice of food and lets the application user choose a creative meal.
